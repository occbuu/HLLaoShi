Cloud computing has also helped to reduce the cost of small and medium enterprises based on cloud provider services. As cloud computing evolves rapidly, researching optimizations such as task execution time, completion time, responce time, and virtual machine resources (VMs) are tremendous challenges. This article proposes an MMSIA algorithm to improve the Max-Min scheduling algorithm, which improves the completion time of the requests by using the ""learned learning"" machine learning, by clustering size of requests and clustering utilization percent of VMs. The algorithm then assigns the largest cluster requests to the VM with the least utilization percent, which is repeated when the request list is empty. In particular, the MMSIA algorithm has improved the completion time. The simulation results show that the proposed MMSIA algorithm has improved the completion time compared to the three algorithms: Max-Min, Min-Min and Roud Robin",Max – Min; load balancing; improve Max – Min algorithm; Processing time.,1

That is the reason why learning Mandarin Chinese is rapidly developing nowadays and it becomes one of the most popular languages in the world. Due to the expanding of Chinese and users’ demand in over the world, teaching Chinese as foreign language is a very necessary mission in Chinese Language Studies. In the past few decades, there are a lot of traditional studies and researches how to teach Chinese as foreign language in around the world, especially speaking English areas. The aim of this paper is to critically analyse a few new methodologies of learning and teaching Chinese recently, to generate those researches’ result to propose a new approach of teaching Chinese as foreign language. This approach, called “Active Mobile Chinese”, is illustrated by using mobile learning method to create a new learning environment for Chinese learners. With this new idea, we can bring the Chinese language to learners anywhere and anytime. Due to the flexibility of mobile learning style, we would propose the content of this method is more on vocabulary: common words and expressions. This seems to be very active because the languages are very common and can be used in daily lives of the society. Our new approach focuses on using the sense of language that learners can easily absorb how to use Chinese with very common words, characters and even expressions. With this language sense, people can slowly grasp and understand Chinese grammar rules. We can do the adjustment for every culture based on this core approach",Active Mobile Chinese; Mobile Learning Style; Chinese for Foreigner; Learning Chinese; Teaching Chinese as a foreign language;,1

Universities always stand in need of coordinating with employers to help themselves catch the demand of market on the labor force. On the other hand, it is good news for enterprises if there is a training agent that can provide labors who can meet their demand. There was a lot of reliable evidence to show that students, teachers, parents, business, schools as a whole and the wider community can all benefit from school–business partnerships.
The Industry 4.0 is an indispensable technology trend that Vietnam must aim to catch up with developed countries in the world with intelligent technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet, automation, technology of 3D printing. Therefore, the demand of quantity and quality human resources in information technology is quite enormously. In this article, we propose a new “connecting model” in undergraduate education to make a closer coordination between enterprises and universities. That is, businesses and enterprises will be directly involved in teaching and training in the course of the school. Content such as training syllabus, assessment process, facilities, teaching staff that are decided by the related businesses. Those solutions relate to universities, enterprises and the labor market as well.

At present, the most important thing that network administrators care about is minimizing the damage to the enterprises when cyber security crimes invade the information system or attack the system anytime. Therefore, how they can proactively protect information, ensure the privacy of users, how to improve the confidentiality and security of information in business system. To solve the problem above, the research ""Early warning solution about system security based on log analysis"" is extremely necessary, because it can help to warn and detect early-attacking information when there are abnormal signs in systems via logs. By inheriting the advantages, as well as overcoming the limitations of those previous related topics in the world, in this paper, we would like to develop and to build an early warning application tool capable of interacting, monitoring, adjusting, notifying from the scouting process of the attackers. The new proposed system in this research is based on the characteristics of attack techniques, components and packets through the system, we design a data collection model of Logs input and output. In order to detect and explore abnormal activities in network which are harmful for information systems, we use the log analysis of the information system with the method of analyzing APT target. We study the APT and its characteristic to build the knowledge that we can use an advanced AI algorithm, Deep & Wide Learning algorithm. With logs testing data we conducted in our LAN, we have reached some good results showed the potential of our proposals.

With this approach, people can have self-diagnosis, classification of cardiovascular pathology and know how to plan the examination and treatment to achieve better outcomes. In this paper, the system is built by using reasoning algorithm combined with supervised learning to carry the diagnosis process through the collection of symptoms. The study was experimented on data collected directly from the medical records at General Hospital of Binh Duong Province, and the experimental results show that the accuracy of diagnosis is over 75% compared to the actual diagnostic results.","Cardiovascular diagnosis, Expert system, Supervised Learning, Diagnosis of the disease, Artificial intelligence",1
